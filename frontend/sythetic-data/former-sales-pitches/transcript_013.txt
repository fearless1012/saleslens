Context: GreenEnergy operates wind farms and solar installations, struggling with equipment downtime.

Transcript:
David: James, thank you for your time. I understand GreenEnergy is managing extensive renewable infrastructure across multiple sites.

James: That's right. We have 15 wind farms and 8 solar installations. Unplanned maintenance is killing our efficiency and revenue projections.

David: Llama 4's predictive maintenance analyzes sensor data, weather conditions, and equipment performance to predict failures 2-4 weeks before they occur. Energy clients reduce downtime by 40-50%.

James: How does it handle the variety of equipment we have - different turbine models, inverters, transformers?

David: The AI adapts to different equipment signatures and learns failure patterns specific to each model and environmental condition. We work with Siemens, GE, and Vestas equipment.

James: What about false positives? We can't afford unnecessary maintenance calls.

David: Excellent point. Our accuracy rate is 92%, and the system provides confidence scores for each prediction. You can set thresholds based on risk tolerance.

James: Interesting. I'd need to see how this works with our SCADA systems and maintenance workflows.

David: Absolutely. Would you be open to a technical demo with your engineering team next week? I can bring our integration specialist.

James: Yes, let's schedule that. I'd also like references from similar renewable energy companies.

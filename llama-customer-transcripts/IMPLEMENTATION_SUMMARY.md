1. **Stage 1: Individual Analysis** - Chain-of-thought reasoning for each conversation
2. **Stage 2: Pattern Analysis** - Cross-conversation pattern identification
3. **Stage 3: Factor Synthesis** - Success/failure factor analysis with causal explanations
4. **Stage 4: Coaching Recommendations** - Actionable training interventions
5. **Stage 5: Knowledge Graph Assembly** - Comprehensive structured output

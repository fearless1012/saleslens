# üß† Advanced Sales Analytics with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

A sophisticated TypeScript application that analyzes sales conversation transcripts using Meta's Llama API with **multi-stage processing** and **chain-of-thought reasoning** to generate comprehensive knowledge graphs and actionable sales insights.

## üåü Key Features

### üß† **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**
- **Step-by-step analysis** of each conversation phase
- **Systematic thinking** through opening, problem discovery, objection handling, emotional dynamics, trust building, and closing
- **Evidence-based insights** with specific examples from conversations
- **Counterfactual reasoning** for learning opportunities ("What if this had been done differently?")

### üöÄ **Multi-Stage Processing Pipeline**
1. **Stage 1**: Individual conversation analysis with chain-of-thought
2. **Stage 2**: Cross-conversation pattern identification  
3. **Stage 3**: Success/failure factor synthesis with causal explanations
4. **Stage 4**: Actionable coaching recommendations generation
5. **Stage 5**: Comprehensive knowledge graph assembly

### üìä **Advanced Sales Intelligence**
- **Psychological trigger analysis** - What emotional factors drive decisions?
- **Conversation flow optimization** - Which sequences lead to success?
- **Trust building/breaking identification** - Critical relationship moments
- **Objection handling mastery** - Effective techniques for common concerns
- **Competitive positioning insights** - How to handle competitor mentions
- **Timing and momentum analysis** - When to advance vs. slow down

### üéØ **Actionable Coaching Outputs**
- **Personalized skill development priorities** ranked by impact
- **Behavioral interventions** (start doing, stop doing, do differently)
- **Real-time coaching cues** for live conversations
- **Role-play scenarios** for practice and training
- **Measurement frameworks** for tracking improvement

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- TypeScript
- Llama API key

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd llama-customer-transcripts

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your LLAMA_API_KEY
```

### Environment Variables

## üöÄ Usage

### Available Test Scripts

```bash
# Chain-of-thought individual analysis
npm run test:cot

# Full multi-stage processing pipeline
npm run test:multistage

# Simple knowledge graph generation
npm run test

# Enhanced comprehensive analysis (legacy)
npm run test:enhanced
```

### Example: Chain-of-Thought Analysis

```typescript
import { LlamaKnowledgeGraphService } from './llamaService';

const service = new LlamaKnowledgeGraphService(apiKey);

// Multi-stage processing with chain-of-thought reasoning
const knowledgeGraph = await service.generateKnowledgeGraphMultiStage(
  'SaaS Customer Support Platform', 
  transcripts
);
```

## üìà Enhanced Analysis Framework

### Chain-of-Thought Process
For each conversation, the system analyzes:

1. **Opening Analysis** - How did the rep start? Customer's initial state?
2. **Problem Discovery** - Effectiveness of pain point identification
3. **Solution Presentation** - Tailored vs. generic approach
4. **Objection Handling** - Techniques used and their effectiveness
5. **Emotional Dynamics** - Triggers, responses, emotional evolution
6. **Trust Building** - Critical moments of connection or disconnection
7. **Closing Analysis** - Techniques attempted and timing
8. **Critical Moments** - 2-3 turning points that determined outcome
9. **Counterfactual Reasoning** - Alternative approaches and their likely outcomes

### Pattern Analysis Across Conversations
- **Success patterns** with frequency and evidence counts
- **Failure patterns** with causal explanations
- **Context dependency** analysis (industry, complexity, timing)
- **Emotional pattern correlation** with outcomes
- **Sequential patterns** that predict success

### Factor Synthesis
- **Primary success factors** ranked by impact strength
- **Primary failure factors** with evidence patterns
- **Interaction effects** between multiple factors
- **Contextual modifiers** that change factor importance
- **Counter-intuitive insights** discovered through analysis

## üìù Example Output

```
üß† CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT ANALYSIS:
================================

1Ô∏è‚É£ OPENING ANALYSIS:
   The rep used a consultative approach by asking about the customer's current evaluation process rather than immediately pitching. This created psychological safety and positioned the rep as an advisor rather than a vendor.

2Ô∏è‚É£ PROBLEM DISCOVERY:
   Excellent use of follow-up questions to uncover both technical issues (slow system, poor integration) and business impact (declining CSAT scores). The rep identified emotional pain (team frustration) and business risk (client concerns).

3Ô∏è‚É£ OBJECTION HANDLING:
   When the customer raised complexity concerns, the rep used social proof (similar company example) and specific implementation timeline to address fears. The training objection was handled with specific details rather than generic assurances.

4Ô∏è‚É£ CRITICAL MOMENTS:
   1. Customer revealing CSAT decline - created urgency
   2. Mentioning biggest client concerns - elevated stakes
   3. ROI calculation moment - justified investment

5Ô∏è‚É£ COUNTERFACTUAL REASONING:
   If the rep had led with features instead of problems, the customer likely would have compared purely on technical specs rather than business value. The outcome probably would have been a longer evaluation cycle or loss to a lower-cost competitor.

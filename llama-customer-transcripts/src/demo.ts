Customer: "Yes, our current system is causing major issues. Response times are terrible and our team is overwhelmed."
Rep: "That sounds incredibly stressful. What's the impact on your customers and team morale?"
Customer: "Our CSAT scores have dropped significantly, and we've had several agents quit. Management is pushing for a solution."
Rep: "I can imagine the pressure. Let me share how a similar company solved this exact problem..."
Customer: "I'd like to hear about that."
Rep: "TechCorp was in a similar situation - declining CSAT, high agent turnover. Within 6 weeks of implementing our solution, they saw a 40% reduction in ticket volume and CSAT improved from 3.2 to 4.6."
Customer: "How is that possible?"
Rep: "AI-powered ticket routing and automated resolution for routine issues. But here's the key - it freed up your agents to focus on complex problems where they add real value."
Customer: "What kind of implementation timeline are we looking at?"
Rep: "Most clients see results in 2-3 weeks. TechCorp was live in 10 days. We include dedicated implementation specialists."
Customer: "And the investment?"
Rep: "For your volume, $2,500 monthly. But let me ask - what's the cost of losing another experienced agent?"
Customer: "Between recruiting and training, easily $50K per person."
Rep: "Exactly. This pays for itself preventing just one departure. Should we schedule a technical review next week?"
Customer: "Yes, let's move forward."`

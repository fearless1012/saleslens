   - Common opening strategies that work
   - Effective problem discovery techniques
   - Solution presentation approaches that resonate
   - Successful objection handling patterns
   - Trust-building behaviors that succeed

2. FAILURE PATTERN IDENTIFICATION: What patterns appear in unsuccessful conversations? Look for:
   - Opening mistakes that create resistance
   - Problem discovery failures
   - Solution presentation mistakes
   - Poor objection handling
   - Trust-breaking behaviors

3. CONTEXT DEPENDENCY: How do patterns vary by:
   - Customer context/industry
   - Problem complexity
   - Competitive landscape
   - Timing factors

4. EMOTIONAL PATTERN ANALYSIS: What emotional patterns correlate with success vs failure?

5. SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS: Are there conversation flow patterns that predict outcomes?

   - Rank by impact strength
   - Provide evidence from multiple conversations
   - Explain cause-and-effect relationships

2. PRIMARY FAILURE FACTORS: What are the top 5 factors that most strongly predict failure?
   - Rank by impact strength
   - Show evidence patterns
   - Explain why these factors cause failure

3. INTERACTION EFFECTS: How do factors interact with each other?
   - Which combinations amplify success?
   - Which combinations guarantee failure?
   - What synergistic effects exist?

4. CONTEXTUAL MODIFIERS: How do context factors change the importance of other factors?

5. COUNTER-INTUITIVE INSIGHTS: What unexpected relationships did you discover?

Provide quantified insights where possible (e.g., "Factor X appears in 80% of successful conversations").`;

1. SKILL DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES: What are the top 5 skills to develop?
   - Rank by impact on success rate
   - Provide specific training approaches
   - Include practice scenarios

2. BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS: What specific behaviors should sales reps:
   - Start doing (new behaviors)
   - Stop doing (harmful behaviors)  
   - Do differently (modifications)

3. PERSONALIZED COACHING PATHS: How should coaching vary by:
   - Experience level (junior vs senior reps)
   - Personality type
   - Current skill gaps
   - Product knowledge level

4. REAL-TIME COACHING CUES: What in-the-moment coaching cues can help during live conversations?

5. MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK: How should progress be measured and tracked?

6. ROLE-PLAY SCENARIOS: What specific practice scenarios would be most valuable?

Make recommendations specific, actionable, and measurable.`;

2. SUCCESS PATTERNS: Distilled success factors with confidence scores

3. FAILURE PATTERNS: Key failure modes with frequency data

4. INSIGHTS: Counter-intuitive and contextual insights

5. NODES AND EDGES: Create a graph structure showing:
   - Technique nodes (opening, objection handling, closing, etc.)
   - Outcome nodes (successful close, lost to competitor, etc.)
   - Pattern nodes (early qualification, demo request, etc.)
   - Objection nodes (price concern, budget constraint, etc.)

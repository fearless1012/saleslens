It can process your transaction data, support tickets, and engagement metrics to predict churn risk weeks in advance. Customer: That sounds promising. How accurate are the predictions? Sales Rep: Our models typically achieve 85-92% accuracy, and we provide confidence scores for each prediction. Customer: Impressive! Can you show me a demo? Sales Rep: Absolutely!

Customer: Honestly, we are worried about patient data security during the transition. Sales Rep: Those are valid concerns. We have helped several practices in similar situations. Dr. Peterson clinic had just 3 weeks to comply last year. Customer: That sounds promising. Sales Rep: We used our rapid deployment protocol - 48-hour data migration with zero downtime, plus we included a dedicated trainer. Customer: What is the investment?
